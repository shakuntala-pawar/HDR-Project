Hand Written Digit Recognition

Project Title: Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST Dataset
Objective
To build a machine learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
Requirements 
 > Programming Language: Python
 > Libraries/Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch), NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Dataset
The MNIST dataset, which can be loaded directly from TensorFlow/Keras or downloaded from other sources.
Steps to Implement
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
3. Model Design
4. Model Design:
5. Model Compilation
6. Model Training
7. Evaluation
8. Prediction


 Outcome
 A trained model that can recognize handwritten digits with high accuracy.
 Insights into the workings of CNNs and image classification.
